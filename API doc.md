##Welcome to the Neura API
**Interacting with the Neura API**

You can query the Neura API to pull information about a user.  All requests for user data must include an authorization header with the value containing the user's access token:

    Authorization: Bearer asdf1234*****************

Permissions - in Android & iOS SDK guides. Specific to each platform. 

##Neura API calls

###The `daily_summary` request
You can use the `daily_summary` request to get a user’s wellness information for a single day.  

- Neura calculates values for `daily_summary` using the current dataset for the user. However,  values may change as the user syncs their devices with Neura, which may update their dataset. 
- `daily_summary` is not available for the current day; it is only available for previous days.

##Build with Neura
We're excited for you to join the community of Builders that are using Neura to enhance their apps and internet-of-things (IoT) devices.  This guide includes a Quickstart project to quickly get you test-driving the Neura API.  We also provide instructions to fully benefit from Neura, including details for using the Neura API and integrating the Neura SDK with your app. 

 - Quickstart with Neura
 - The Neura API
 - The Neura SDK for Android
 - The Neura SDK for iOS

###Quickstart project
This 10-minute project will allow you to use Neura's `daily_summary` API call to get basic wellness information for our teammate Betty **(Gili - delete PII)** who generated a test dataset   This project should take you less than 10 minutes.

####Quickstart project instructions:
  1. Install Postman for Chrome (or use your favorite REST client packaged app) **put in Postman link here**  If you're having trouble with Postman, here's a good tutorial for reference. **youtube link**
  2. Select a 'Normal' `Get` request
  3. Under `Request URL` enter https://wapi.theneura.com/v1/users/profile/daily_summary 
  4. Under `URL Parameter Key` enter `date`
  5. Under `URL Parameter Value` enter `2014-07-04`
  6. Under `Header` enter `Authorization`
  7. Under  `Header Value` enter **`Bearer asdf1234********`(update)**
  8. Send the `Get` request
  9. Check out the JSON response to see Betty's wellness information on July 4th, 2014.  To better understand the response, please see `daily_summary` in the **Neura API documentation (include link)**.
  10. You can play with the `date` value to see variations in Betty's dataset. Note that the dataset is only available from June to August 2014 (from `2014-06-01` to `2014-08-31`**define limits**). 
 
####Examine your own data with the Quickstart project
You can examine your data by getting your unique `Authorization Key`**Is that what it's called?** from Neura for the `daily_summary` call.  

  1.  Download the Neura app on your Android or iOS mobile phone. **include app & play store links** 
  2. Email build@theneura.com to request an access code to complete installation of the app.  In the email, please be sure to note that you're a Builder working on a Quickstart project.  
  3. Neura will respond with your `Authorization Key`.
  4. Have fun playing around with your data. We hope it gives you a small taste of the power of Neura and motivates you to integrate your apps and IoT devices with Neura.
